//What is the difference between Do-While and While Loop?
//The main difference between the two loops is that the while loop checks the 
//condition before the execution of the statement(s) whereas the do-while loop ensures that
// the statement(s) are executed at least once before evaluating the condition. While loop 
//is entry-controlled and Do-while is exit controlled.
//========================================================================



//How does the Do-While loop work?
//The do while loop checks the condition at the end of the loop. This means that the statements
// inside the loop body will be executed at least once even if the condition is never true. 
//The do while loop is an exit controlled loop, where even if the test condition is false, the
// loop body will be executed at least once.

//==============================================================================================



//How does the For-Loop work?
//a for loop functions by running a section of code repeatedly until a certain condition 
//has been satisfied.

//=========================================================================================

//Is it possible to skip or omit parts of the for-loop settings?
//Any part of for can be skipped.
